\begin{abstract}
    Image inpainting is the technique to modifiy an image where the 
    inpainted area is unpredictable. There are already numerous methods
    introduced by former researchers to handle image inpainting including
    partial differential equations and Markov random fields. These methods
    all root in smoothing and have a immediate drawback of blurring.

    In this paper, we look deep into another kind of inpainting technique:
    examplar-based inpainting algorithm and further propose a method 
    inspired by the idea of priority queue. When we inpaint an image, we
    give different priority to the patches around the area to be inpainted
    and in this way we inpaint patches that capture the structure of the
    image better.

    Our experiments show that the idea of priority queue works well and
    is suitable for inpainting images with complex structure.
