\section{Acknowledgements}
We got a lot of help from my Software Engineering teacher Professor Sheng Bin while we are writing the paper. He had given us appropriate example and knowledge in order to make us understand more about this Software Engineering study. We faced many problems during coding and writing but our teaching assistant always companies with us. So we also appreciate the teaching assistants Saleha Masood. Saleha has a meeting with us every two weeks. She spends her time to find information for us to carry out the project. Also thanks other groups which willing to share their information about Software Engineering study. They give us a lot if new ideas about the project.
