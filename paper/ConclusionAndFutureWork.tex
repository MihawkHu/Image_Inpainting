\section{Conclusion and future work}
This paper has presented a novel algorithm for image inpainting. The result is an image in
which the selected object has been replaced by a visually plausible background that mimics the appearance of the source region. Given the mask region and input image, our algorithm can do image inpainting and get good result as shown in this paper. 

Our algorithm is capable of different size of input mask and can apply to different kinds of scenarios including image text removal, image object removal and image detail restoration. Our method can successfully solve these problem efficiently.

In the future, we plan to increase the process speed and get better image inainting result. Also, we plan to try some new model such as deep learning model on topic. We plan to set up an estimate of the result, which can get more directly comparing result of different image inpainting method.
