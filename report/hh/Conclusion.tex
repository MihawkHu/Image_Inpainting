\begin{enumerate}
	\item We accomplished the chosen task and solved the problem. The result works well.
	\item The proposed ideas given by us successfully solve the Image Inpainting problem.
	\item As for our Use-Case and three different applicable scenarios, our software works well and it successfully solve some image inpainting problem in our daily life. 
	\item Our algorithm is capable of different size of input mask and can apply to different kinds of scenarios including image text removal, image object removal and image detail restoration. Our method can successfully solve these problem efficiently.
